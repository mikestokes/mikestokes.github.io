As a developer I find the typical flow used for blogging to be less than ideal. I want a flow that embraces the tools I use on a daily basis.

Luckily Github has a great feature called Pages that allows us devs to host static content as a web site - they even allow us to associate a custom domain name (e.g. example.com) with the web site. And best of all this is all free and super easy to set up!

## Github Pages
Github Pages supports an enhanced version of [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) for us to create content and a powerful templating / pre-processor called [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) to process the Markdown to create static sites.

Follow these simple steps to get a Blog setup and hosted on Github quickly:

### Cloning the Jekyll Repository
You have a Github account right?  If not, jump over there now and [create one for free quickly](https://github.com/).

The easiest way to get started is to clone an existing Jekyll repository that contains everything you need to get started. This will form the basis of your Blog.

I have tried a few and prefer either [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) or [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde).  I used Hyde as the basis of this blog and it gives you a great start.

* Visit the repository you want to clone.
* Click the Fork button.
