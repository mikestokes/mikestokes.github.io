As a developer I find the typical flow ant tools used for blogging to be less than ideal. I want a flow that embraces the tools I use on a daily basis and makes it as easy as possible to blog...

> What I want is an optimized blogging platform and experience targetted to developers.

## What about Wordpress?

I could have used [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) and [WP Engine](http://wpengine.com/), an excellent solution to be sure. But, it doesn't really tick the developer flow or simplicity requirement.

## GitHub to the Rescue

Github has a great feature called **Github Pages** that allows us devs to host static content as a web site - they even allow us to associate a custom domain name (e.g. example.com) with the web site. Could this be suitable?

GitHub Pages offers the following capabilities that are relevant to us:

 * Pre-processing and templating support via Jekyll
 * Quick start blogging templates like [JekyllNow](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) (this blog is based on Poole / [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde))
 * Markdown support as the blogging format
 * Git commit publishing (even publish directly from GitHub)
 * Custom domain names can be pointed to your static pages
 * Supports commenting, categories, tags etc easily or with little change
 * Easy to set up and get going with
 * It's free and fast!

### Building the GitHub Pages Blog

So with this information, I decided to MVP blog using GitHub Pages and see how it went.

I decided to use the Hyde repository as a starting point as it looked quite beautiful and was simple to understand and enhance.

#### Cloning the Hyde Repository

If you don't already have a GitHub account, jump over there now and [create one for free](https://github.com/).

Once you're logged into your GitHub account, the quickest way to get started is to clone an existing Jekyll repository to modify. As stated, I decided to use Hyde, so to do the same, visit the [Hyde repository](https://github.com/poole/hyde) and click the Fork button ![Hyde Repository Fork](http://mikestokes.co/public/img/fork-hype-repo.png)




I have tried a few and prefer either [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) or [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde).  I used Hyde as the basis of this blog and it gives you a great start.

* Visit the repository you want to clone.
* Click the Fork button.
