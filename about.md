I am a Technical Lead working in exciting areas of Tech from Aucland, New Zealand. From a young age (yep, we have a [Vic 20](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20)!), I've been facinated with computers and getting them to do things. I teach coders on a daily basis and I want to use this website to help capture some of that and share it with you!

My current love affair with tech includes my favourites:

 * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), especially hosting it as Micro-Services in the Cloud.
 * [Amazone AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) and [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), love them both for different reasons. Once again both support Micro-Services :) Both also offer free tiers for you to play with and it's often enough to get to launch!
 * [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) for when you want to create a mdeium+ complexity JS app, you can't go past Anguilar JS for it's solid support of patterns.
 * [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/), simply brilliant with [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) for cross-platform mobile development. The Ionic guys amaze me on a weekly basis!
 * [.NET and Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com), this ones a bit controversial I know but I love the newer OWIN stack and direction Microsoft is going with this.

Some of my "side projects" include:

#### Codename "HotLunch"
Launching soon as an MVP, this is a super exciting project a bunch of us have been working on to help people quickly create APIs in the Cloud. Stay tuned!

#### [Gingerbread Kids](http://gingerbreadkids.com/)
A bunch of Patents creating educational Maths apps for kids in the Primary (Elementary for Americans) kids.

#### [Click to Convert](http://clicktoconvert.com/)
We created this document conversion tech as a side project in 1999 and sold our first copy on January 1st, 2000. It kept us busy and growing a business for 10 years and taught us a huge amnount about things us coders don't find intuitive like market positioning, marketing, sales and of course support :)

Thanks for reading!
